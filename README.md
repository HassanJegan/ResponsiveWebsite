# ResponsiveWebsite
Overhauled a static html page into a mobile-friendly responsive page

The changes I made to the design of the original website to make it more mobile friendly are the following:

-	Added HTML semantics tags
-	Scaled image with respect to the size of the screen
-	navigation layout changes based on size of screen through the use of media queries
-	content layout changes based on size of screen through the use of media queries
-	used fonts that are more legible on mobile devices
-	used font colors that are legible on white background
-	Changed the .gif images to .png images since mobile devices nowadays better support .png files than .gif files
